Those causing economic damage as needle diseases in conifers are the least poorly known. Their positive value as nutrient recyclers, and their possible protective role as endobionts is almost completely unevaluated. Most records are from the north temperate to subarctic zones, or from southern South America and Australasia; many collections are on conifers, the Ericaceae and Gramineae. Some species are widespread and plurivorous; others highly host-specific and limited in distribution.",Oct 2017,2017-10-27,769,\N,Minter D.W.,\N,\N,\N,\N,0,1914,0,Global,95,4

The intent of this collaborative effort is to provide a hierarchical classification serving not only the needs of the CoL's database providers but also the diverse public-domain user community, most of whom are familiar with the Linnaean conceptual system of ordering taxon relationships. This classification is neither phylogenetic nor evolutionary but instead represents a consensus view that accommodates taxonomic choices and practical compromises among diverse expert opinions, public usages, and conflicting evidence about the boundaries between taxa and the ranks of major taxa, including kingdoms. Certain key issues, some not fully resolved, are addressed in particular. Beyond its immediate use as a management tool for the CoL and ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System), it is immediately valuable as a reference for taxonomic and biodiversity research, as a tool for societal communication, and as a classificatory """"backbone"""" for biodiversity databases, museum collections, libraries, and textbooks. Such a modern comprehensive hierarchy has not previously existed at this level of specificity."" <i>PLoS ONE 10(4): e0119248. doi:10.1371/jou</i>",2015,2015-04-29,\N,\N,"Ruggiero M.A., Gordon D.P., Orrell T.M., Bailly N., Bourgoin T., Brusca R.C., Cavalier-Smith T., Guiry M.D., Kirk P.M.",\N,\N,\N,\N,\N,\N,0,Global,\N,\N
